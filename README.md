# Medical Cost prediction
## Main goals
<p>The main goal here was to preactice linear regression and develop a model that would explain the medical charges and predict others.</p>
## About the dataset
<p>The dataset is from Kaggle, the link to the dataset is on the bottom of the README, it contains seven columns. The first 6 columns gives a description of the person using the medical service, and the last one gives us the charges for the medical services.</p>
## The model developed
<p>It was build two models actually, one of them for the smokers pacients and other for the non smokers pacients.</p>
<p>I did it this way because of the charges per age scatter plot, where we see that the plot is divided in two parts, smokers and non smokers. Which was partialy successful, the model for the smokers worked well, with R2 score of 0.7435, but the non smokers model had a R2 score of 0.4485.</p>
